## ✨ Core Features

* **🎨 Intuitive Creation Wizard:** A step-by-step interface guides users from vehicle selection to final design, making decal creation accessible to everyone.
* **🤖 AI-Powered Generation:** Leverages advanced AI models (like `Stable Diffusion XL`) to generate unique decal textures based on user prompts, style selections, and color palettes.
* **👁️ Real-Time 3D Preview:** Visualize your decal instantly on a 3D model of your selected Rocket League vehicle with zoom, pan, and rotation controls.
* **🔄 Iteration & History:** Easily compare different generated versions side-by-side and revert to previous iterations with a built-in history tracker.
* **🔧 Advanced Customization (Planned):** Fine-tune generation parameters and potentially utilize layer-based editing for intricate designs.
* **🖼️ Style Categories:** Choose from diverse visual styles (e.g., Futuristic, Retro, Abstract, Graffiti, Cyberpunk) to guide the AI.
* **🎨 Smart Color Palettes:** Select from pre-configured harmonious color schemes or define your own.
* **⚙️ Export Compatibility:** Download your creations packaged with necessary files (`diffuse`, `normal`, `specular` maps, config `.json`) for use in Rocket League (via modding tools like BakkesMod or AlphaConsole).
* **🌐 Community Gallery (Future):** Browse, share, and rate decals created by the community.

## 🚀 How It Works

The process is designed to be seamless for the user while handling complex operations in the background:

1.  **Input & Configuration (Frontend):**
    * User accesses the web interface (built with `React.js` and `TailwindCSS`).
    * Selects a Rocket League vehicle (previewed using `Three.js`).
    * Chooses a style category and color palette.
    * Enters a descriptive text prompt (e.g., "flaming cybernetic wolf").
    * (Optional) Adjusts advanced settings.
2.  **Prompt Engineering & AI Request (Backend):**
    * The system enhances the user's prompt with style-specific keywords.
    * The request is queued (`Redis`) and sent to the **Generation Service**.
    * The Generation Service interacts with the AI model API (`Stable Diffusion XL` via `Replicate.com` or similar). `ControlNet` may be used for style consistency and contour adherence.
3.  **Generation & Post-Processing (Backend):**
    * The AI generates raw image outputs based on the engineered prompt.
    * A custom pipeline processes these images:
        * Converts them into UV-mapped decal textures.
        * Generates corresponding normal maps for detail.
        * Creates alpha channels for transparency.
4.  **Preview & Iteration (Frontend/Backend):**
    * The generated decal files are sent back to the user's interface for 3D preview.
    * User reviews the decal, requests regeneration if needed, or approves the design.
5.  **Compilation & Download (Backend):**
    * Upon approval, the **Compilation Service** packages the final textures (`.png`), metadata (`.json`), and any other necessary maps.
    * The complete package is stored temporarily (e.g., `AWS S3`) and made available for download.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** `React.js`, `Redux` (or similar state management), `Three.js` (for 3D previews), `TailwindCSS`, `Framer Motion` (for animations)
* **Backend:** `Node.js` (API Gateway, orchestration), `Python` (AI processing, `FastAPI`)
* **AI Model:** `Stable Diffusion XL` (potentially fine-tuned)
* **AI Integration:** `Replicate.com API`, `Stability.ai API`, or self-hosted solution
* **Database:** `MongoDB` (User data, creation history), `Redis` (Caching, request queueing)
* **Infrastructure:** `AWS` (EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, potentially Kubernetes/EKS), `Docker`
* **CI/CD:** `GitHub Actions` or `CircleCI`
* **Monitoring:** `Prometheus`, `Grafana`
* **Other Services:** `Stripe` (Payments), `Auth0`/`Firebase Auth` (Authentication), `Mixpanel`/`Google Analytics` (Analytics)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application employs a **distributed microservices architecture** for scalability and maintainability:

* **User Service:** Manages authentication, user profiles, preferences, and creation history.
* **Generation Service:** Handles communication with the AI API, manages the generation queue, and performs initial image processing.
* **Compilation Service:** Transforms raw AI outputs into Rocket League-compatible packages and manages temporary asset storage.
* **Gallery Service (Future):** Stores, retrieves, and manages community-shared creations.
* **API Gateway:** A central entry point (`Node.js`) orchestrates requests between the frontend and various backend services.

This design allows individual components to be scaled, updated, or maintained independently. Cloud infrastructure (`AWS`) will be utilized for auto-scaling compute resources (including GPU instances for AI) and efficient tiered storage. A Content Delivery Network (`CDN`) will ensure fast asset delivery globally.

## 📈 Scalability & Performance

* **Cloud-Native:** Leverages cloud services (`AWS`) for automatic scaling based on demand.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Generation requests are queued and processed asynchronously to handle load and provide a responsive user experience.
* **Optimized AI Interaction:** Techniques like request batching will be explored to optimize costs and throughput with the AI API.
* **Efficient Storage:** Tiered storage (`Redis`, `S3`, potentially Glacier/Cold Storage) balances access speed and cost.
* **Frontend Performance:** Focus on asset optimization (compression, lazy loading), efficient WebGL rendering (`Three.js`), and incremental UI rendering.
* **CDN:** Edge caching of static assets and popular/recent decals reduces latency.

## 💡 Monetization Concept

While providing core functionality for free, sustainability and feature development will be supported through a tiered model:

* **Free Tier:** Limited generations per month, basic styles, standard resolution, watermarked output.
* **Standard Tier:** Increased monthly generations, access to all standard styles, high-resolution, no watermarks.
* **Premium Tier:** Unlimited generations, priority queue access, exclusive styles, full format export options, early access to new features.

*Additional potential revenue streams:* One-time purchase style packs, B2B partnerships, API access.
