## Getting Started

The Rocket League Decal Generator is a web application that you can access through your browser. No installation is required to use the application itself, but you will need Bakkesmod or AlphaConsole installed to use the generated decals in Rocket League.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Rocket League installed on your PC
- [Bakkesmod](https://bakkesmod.com/) or [AlphaConsole](https://alphaconsole.net/) installed and configured

## Creating a Decal

Creating a custom decal is a simple process:

1. **Navigate to the Create Page**: Click on "Create" in the navigation menu or the "Start Creating" button on the home page.

2. **Describe Your Decal**: In the text area, enter a detailed description of what you want your decal to look like. Be as specific as possible for the best results. For example:
   - "A flaming cybernetic wolf with neon blue accents and circuit patterns"
   - "Abstract geometric patterns with a synthwave color scheme"
   - "Carbon fiber texture with racing stripes and a metallic finish"

3. **Choose Your Colors**: Select up to 5 colors that you want to be featured in your decal. These colors will guide the AI generation process.
   - The first color is considered the primary color
   - You can add or remove colors using the buttons provided
   - Click on the color swatch to open a color picker

4. **Generate Your Decal**: Click the "Generate Decal" button to start the AI generation process. This may take a few moments as the AI creates your custom decal.

5. **Preview and Iterate**: Once generated, your decal will be displayed on a 3D Octane model in the preview panel. You can:
   - Rotate the model to view the decal from different angles
   - Generate a new decal if you're not satisfied with the result
   - Download the decal when you're happy with it

## Viewing Your Decals

All your created decals are saved and can be accessed through the Gallery:

1. **Navigate to the Gallery**: Click on "Gallery" in the navigation menu.

2. **Browse Your Decals**: The gallery displays all your created decals with:
   - A preview image
   - The name and description
   - The current status (processing, completed, or failed)
   - A link to view details

3. **View Decal Details**: Click on "View Details" to see more information about a specific decal, including:
   - A larger 3D preview
   - The full description and color scheme
   - Download options
   - Installation instructions

## Installing Decals in Rocket League

To use your custom decals in Rocket League:

1. **Download the Decal Package**: From either the creation page or the decal details page, click the "Download Decal Package" button.

2. **Extract the ZIP File**: The downloaded file is a ZIP archive containing all necessary files for the decal. Extract it to a temporary location.

3. **Install in Bakkesmod/AlphaConsole**:
   - **For Bakkesmod**: Copy all extracted files to `[Rocket League Directory]/Bakkesmod/data/textures/Decals/`
   - **For AlphaConsole**: Copy all extracted files to the appropriate AlphaConsole decals directory (refer to AlphaConsole documentation)

4. **Use In-Game**: Launch Rocket League and use the Bakkesmod or AlphaConsole interface to select your custom decal for the Octane.

## Troubleshooting

### Decal Generation Issues

- **Generation Failed**: If the AI generation fails, try:
  - Using a different description with more specific details
  - Selecting different colors
  - Trying again later if the service is experiencing high demand

- **Decal Looks Different Than Expected**: The AI interprets your text description to create the decal. If it's not what you expected:
  - Try using more specific language in your description
  - Include references to specific styles or elements
  - Adjust your color selection to better match your vision

### Installation Issues

- **Decal Not Appearing In-Game**: If your decal doesn't appear in Rocket League:
  - Verify that you've placed the files in the correct directory
  - Check that Bakkesmod/AlphaConsole is properly installed and running
  - Restart Rocket League after installing the decal
  - Ensure you're selecting the Octane vehicle (current version only supports Octane)

## FAQ

**Q: Can I create decals for vehicles other than the Octane?**  
A: The current version only supports the Octane vehicle. Support for additional vehicles is planned for future updates.

**Q: Can other players see my custom decals?**  
A: No, custom decals applied through Bakkesmod or AlphaConsole are only visible to you, not to other players in online matches.

**Q: How many decals can I create?**  
A: There is currently no limit to the number of decals you can create.

**Q: Can I edit a decal after it's been generated?**  
A: The current version doesn't support editing existing decals. If you want to make changes, you'll need to create a new decal.

**Q: Is this approved by Psyonix/Epic Games?**  
A: This tool creates decals for use with Bakkesmod/AlphaConsole, which are client-side modifications. Using these mods is at your own risk, though they have been widely used in the community for years without issues.

**Q: Can I share my decals with others?**  
A: Yes, you can share the downloaded ZIP files with others. They can install them following the same installation instructions.
